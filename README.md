Idea: Make "Self sovereign identity" digital.
What is 'Self-sovereign identity'?: Your wallet in the analog world: You decide who you hand over your id.

Problem: How do you exchange your public key? (old public key dilemma)

-> Solution: "Decentralised Digital Identifier" - The address of a public key on the blockchain
Anyone you wanna share secrets with you simply provide your digital identifier where your public key is stored.

NONE of our privite credentials go on the ledger only ! No address, no name, no age.
